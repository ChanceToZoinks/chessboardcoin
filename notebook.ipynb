We denote these sections using a two-tuple (x, y) where x is the power 2 will be raised to, called the *region*, and y is called the *side*.

We will occasionally refer to a region without reference to its side or its normal/dual-ness when it is convenient and unlikely to cause confusion.

    "## Parity\n",
    "A chess board has 2^6 = 64 squares on it. Thus we need a way to express 6 bits of information to be able to accurately communicate the location of the hidden key on the board. A coin can only express a single bit of information on its own - either heads or tails. By choosing {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} as our regions we can divide the board into 6 regions, and their associated duals, such that exactly 32 squares are in each region and exactly 16 squares are in the intersection of any pair of regions. Every region, and therefore every dual, has a number associated to it called its *parity*. By our convention the parity of a region is the sum of the number of heads in the region modulo 2, or in the other words it is either 0 or 1 indicating that the number of heads in the region is even or odd respectively. By the law of the excluded middle the parity of a region always changes if a coin in that region is flipped. Therefore, flipping the coin flips the parity of any regions and/or duals the coin is in, allowing us to communicate 6 bits of information with a single coin flip."

In devising the following strategy it was assumed the board was approached from the perspective of \"white\" in a normal chess game and the top-left square was assumed to be square 0 (coordinates (0, 0)) while the bottom right was square 63 (coordinates (7, 7)). Really the players just need a consistent way to identify each square; the actual geometry of the board is completely irrelevant as long as their are 64 \"squares,\" and they can be identified by both players. One can easily imagine that instead of a chessboard there were just 64 squares in a line maybe with numeric markings on them indicating which square was which, or perhaps every second square in every second row on the chessboard is swapped with the one in the row beneath it starting with the first (See [Example: Strategy is invariant under geometric transformations](#example-strategy-is-invariant-under-geometric-transformations)).\n",

Repeat this for (1,0)/(1,1), (2,0)/(2,1), ....
