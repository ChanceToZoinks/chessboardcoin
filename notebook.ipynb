A side of 0 indicates the region is *normal* while a side of 1 indicates the region is *dual*. We will occasionally refer to a normal region or a section as just a region when it is convenient and unlikely to cause confusion. Every region has a dual, and the two are independent of each other.

    "## Parity\n",
    "A chess board has 2^6 = 64 squares on it. Thus we need a way to express 6 bits of information to be able to accurately communicate the location of the hidden key on the board. A coin can only express a single bit of information on its own - either heads or tails. By choosing {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} as our regions we can divide the board into 6 regions, and their associated duals, such that exactly 32 squares are in each region and exactly 16 squares are in the intersection of any pair of regions. Every region, and therefore every dual, has a number associated to it called its *parity*. By our convention the parity of a region is the sum of the number of heads in the region modulo 2, or in the other words it is either 0 or 1 indicating that the number of heads in the region is even or odd respectively. By the law of the excluded middle the parity of a region always changes if a coin in that region is flipped. Therefore, flipping the coin flips the parity of any regions and/or duals the coin is in, allowing us to communicate 6 bits of information with a single coin flip."
